# Visualizing Electric Scooter Rides Around Minneapolis in 2021

This project can be run with Processing.

The data folder within the ScooterMap folder should contain:
    1) Minneapolis Centerline data (already in this repository)
        - Downloaded from https://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/datasets/mpls-centerline/explore as a Shapefile. There are a lot of different files all called "MPLS_Centerline" all with different extensions that should be there.
    2) Minneapolis Scooter data (not currently in this repository, as it is a large file)
        - Download from https://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/datasets/cityoflakes::motorized-foot-scooter-trips-2021/about as a CSV file.  The file name should be "Motorized_Foot_Scooter_Trips_2021".
